# Simple-Chatbot
I have created a simple streamlit app that gives us a simple chatbot experience for viewers. We can upload only CSV or EXCEL files into the app.
I have also attached a cancer dataset(CSV) from one of my projects. You can upload and ask various questions like--"How many columns are there in this dataset",
"How many are benign and malignant",etc..
This is simply to play with the LLM concepts as this is my first AI experience of my own.
**Thanks for reading it and all the best!**
